# hello-world
Long ago in a distant fairy land
There Was a man known far and wide
He was know to eat any meat
Human, chicken, horse or bovine
And then.
On the big day, t'was his largest feast yet
He rolled himself in a ball and,
oh what a feat, he is one with the meat
He is the only meatball man
Though he'd become one with the meat
He was still hungry for more
He scoured the land
For all the meat
He could roll up and engorge
